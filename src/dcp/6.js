// Problem 6
//
// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list.
// Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both,
// which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node.
//
// Implement an XOR linked list;
// it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
//
// If using a language that has no pointers (such as Javascript),
// you can assume you have access to getPointer and dereferencePointer functions
// that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
//
// WARNING: CODE DOES NOT RUN
//
// add(element): O(1) Time complexity and Space complexity
// get(index): O(N) Time complexity and O(1) Space complexity
// N is the number of nodes in the linked list
