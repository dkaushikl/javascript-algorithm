// There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

// You have given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i â€“ j|.

// You want to type a string word. Write a program to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

// Input :- Keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", Word = "cba"
// Output :- 4
// Input :- Keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", Word = "hello"
// Output :- 31
