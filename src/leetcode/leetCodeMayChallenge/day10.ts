/* Question 10: Find the Town Judge (May 10 2020)

In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3

1 <= N <= 1000
trust.length <= 10000
trust[i] are all different
trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

/**
 * @param {number} N
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 */
var findJudge = function(N, trust) {
  const town = new Array(N + 1).fill(0);

  for (let [person1, person2] of trust) {
    town[person1] -= 1;
    town[person2] += 1;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < town.length; i++) {
    if (N - 1 === town[i]) return i;
  }

  return -1;
};
